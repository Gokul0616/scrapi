## 9. Known Issues & Limitations

### 9.1 Minor Issues
- ⚠️ PostHog analytics requests failing (doesn't affect core functionality)
- ⚠️ System actors cannot be updated by users (expected security behavior)

### 9.2 Limitations (By Design - MVP Scope)
- ⏳ Only one pre-built actor (Google Maps Scraper)
- ⏳ No custom actor creation UI (backend supports it)
- ⏳ No run scheduling
- ⏳ No webhooks for run completion
- ⏳ Basic proxy system (no advanced rotation strategies)
- ⏳ No API key authentication (only JWT)
- ⏳ No team/organization features

**Note:** These are not bugs but features outside current MVP scope. The platform is designed to support these features in future iterations.
